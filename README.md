# Ensemble Learning Examples

This repository contains Python code demonstrating various ensemble learning techniques using Scikit-learn and XGBoost. The code includes implementations of Voting Classifier, Bagging, Random Forest, Extra-Trees, AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost, applied to classification and regression tasks.

## Overview
The code showcases:
- **Voting Classifier**: Combining Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and SVM for classification.
- **Bagging and Pasting**: Using BaggingClassifier with Decision Trees and out-of-bag evaluation.
- **Random Forest**: Training a Random Forest Classifier and analyzing feature importance on the Iris dataset.
- **Extra-Trees**: Implementing extremely randomized trees.
- **AdaBoost**: Using AdaBoostClassifier with Decision Trees.
- **Gradient Boosting**: Training GradientBoostingRegressor and implementing early stopping.
- **XGBoost**: Using XGBoost for regression with early stopping.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Scikit-learn
- NumPy
- XGBoost

Install dependencies using:
```bash
pip install scikit-learn numpy xgboost
